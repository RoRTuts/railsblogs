Hello everyone, as everyone knows Rails 4 released. The Rails Guide are not always enough. When you don't find something in the guides or docs, you probably search for information on the internet or a blog post about the specific subject. But wouldn't it be better if you had all the related information together? :). This could also be a great starting point for a new Rails guide.
